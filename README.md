# Airline Satisfaction Prediction Project Featuring Streamlit

## Project Descirption

Welcome to the Airline Satisfaction Prediction Project featuring Streamlit! This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer satisfaction with airlines based on a dataset available on Kaggle. In this project, I will be performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Plotly, build predictive models using KNN, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, and then showcasing the process and results through a Streamlit app.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Airline Passenger Satisfaction" dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction/data). The dataset contains information about airline passengers, including features such as flight distance, seat comfort, inflight entertainment, and more.

## Contents

In this project, the airline satisfaction dataset is read into a Jupyter Notebook 

This notebook shows the progress of my analysis, from data cleaning tasks to utilizing Plotly for initial exploratory data analysis (EDA). During this process, I will showcase interactive visualizations to gain insights into the dataset. Subsequently, I will employ machine learning techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to build predictive models. Then evaluate and compare the performance of these models to determine their effectiveness in predicting airline satisfaction by comparing them to a baseline model! 

Lastly, the findings in this notebook will be presented in a Streamlit app, providing an interactive and user-friendly platform to showcase the results of your analysis and model performance.
